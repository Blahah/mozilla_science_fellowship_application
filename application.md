### Name

Richard Smith-Unna

### Email

### What institution are you based at currently?

University of Cambridge

### What is your role at the institution?

Graduate student

### What research fields are you in?

Plant biology, agriculture, bioinformatics, computational biology

### What is your research focus? 50 words max

I study photosynthesis, the process that creates sugar from the carbon in air and the energy in light. The goal is to understand how a very efficient kind of photosynthesis called C4 works at the genetic level. I build software to address this question using high throughput RNA sequencing data.

### Describe to us your current research team. 50 words max

We are a diverse group of 9 plant scientists hailing from 5 different countries with collective expertise in molecular biology, botany, biochemistry, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics. We collaborate with many groups locally and internationally. I also independently collaborate with research groups in several other countries over the internet.

### Describe to us how open science advances your research. 100 words max

*TODO: turn this into prose*

So many ways!

- tools and techniques developed by others underlie all my research
- engaging with other researchers on the internet helps me develop better ideas, keep informed about the latest tools, discoveries and ideas, form collaborations
- open platforms have enabled collaborations that would have been difficult before
- being open by default has improved my work by getting constant feedback from a diverse audience
- using exclusively open source software allows us to fix bugs when we encounter them
- explicit and permissive restrictions on (re)use lowers friction in all my work
- commitment to openness helps hold myself to high standards

### What work are you currently involved in that's relevant to being an open science leader? Are you leading any projects related to open science? 100 words max.

*TODO*

- Transrate
- ContentMine
- BioJulia
- Solvers

### How would this fellowship accelerate your work? 50 words max.

During my PhD I have had to focus on my research and work on projects in Open Science in my spare time. The fellowship would allow me to devote myself to developing my projects and ideas, and to use all my energy to work for positive change.

### What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project? 100 words max.

Cambridge University offers little support and training around open science, despite a local abundance of interested people and organisations. I propose a new program, a School of Open Science, providing training in key skills for open science. The program would bring together the local open science community to create and deliver training, and aim to unite the community to drive political change in the university. I would cultivate support within the university with the aim of having the program sustained in the long term. The program would provide a template that could be implemented at other universities.

### What do you think needs to change most immediately in the system? 50 words max.

I think the crucial problem is cultural: being closed by default, with the perception of openness as a threat or risk. The vanguard of people who reject this culture is highly visible on the internet but does not hold the balance of power or opinion in many institutions and communities.

### What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web?

*TODO*

### Why is the the open web important to you? 100 words max.

*TODO*

*Note: this question is a bit ambiguous. The 'open web' could refer to the [Open Web Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web) and the associated [Open Web Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform), which Mozilla is heavily involved in. Or it could refer to the use of the web to further open science, which I suspect is how most applicants will interpret it.*
