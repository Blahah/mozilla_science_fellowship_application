## Fellowship project ideas

> What do you see as the opportunities for impact around open research at your university? Could you leverage this opportunity in a potential project?

### Cambridge brain dump

- very old, rich by UK standards
- has an excellent reputation globally - seen as a leader
- vast, and with a very unusual structure (college system)
- very competitive internally
- very traditional and can be antiquated, but also very progressive in some ways
- university-level open access support openaccess.cam.ac.uk
- culturally very non-open - huge focus on glamour journals and impact factor
- some cross-department 'open' projects within cambridge, e.g openplant
- open culture in the city - e.g. makerspace
- open access publishing has a home here - e.g. eLife and PLOS headquarters
- support for openness varies greatly between departments e.g. Genetics is high, plant sci is low
- many sympathetic people within the library - strong will at the highest level
- poor training of graduate students
- most graduate students have no required taught classes

### Vague ideas

- Something targetted at individual students or researchers
  - open science course
    - split into modules teaching core concepts - publishing, collaboration, data, coding
    - each module delivered multiple times throughout the year

- Something at university level, or cross-department
  - department-level commitment to pre-print depositing
  - commitment to science gists
  - data archiving agreements at a high level - centralised tracking of researchers data deposits

- Something that engages the public with the university
  - site that allows public to get involved with research at cambridge at any level:
    - funding
    - suggesting research ideas
    - asking science questions
    - helping with research - citizen science or giving skills
    - accessing the results of research - reading papers, seeing data, talks

- School of open science
  - across graduate school of life sciences
  - develop and deliver training
    - software carpentry
    - data carpentry
    - data reuse and mining
    - public engagement
    - social media
    - collaboration tools
    - legal issues - licenses etc.
